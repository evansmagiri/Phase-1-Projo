# Phase 1 Aviation Risk Analysis

## Overview
Analysis of NTSB aviation accidents (1962-2023) to identify low-risk aircraft for business expansion.

## Business Understanding
Stakeholder: Aviation division head. Questions: Which aircraft have fewest accidents? What factors reduce risk?

## Data Understanding and Analysis
Source: NTSB dataset, cleaned to 23,850 unique accidents. Columns: type, fatalities, year, country.
According to Visualizations: [accident_counts.png], [trends.png], [country_plot.png] I therefore,
Conclude: High-risk types (e.g., Douglas C-47A, 1,916 accidents);
           low-risk (e.g., Vought-Sikorsky VS-44, 1 accident).
